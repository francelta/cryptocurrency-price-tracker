# cryptocurrency-price-tracker
This repository contains a Python script named take_data_coins.py, designed to track and store real-time prices of popular cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ripple (XRP). It leverages the Bybit API for fetching prices and stores the data in local SQLite databases, thus allowing for easy data access and persistence.
